Project 0x02: Minimum Operations
Description

This project aims to solve the "Minimum Operations" problem where, given a number n, the task is to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n characters in a text file containing a single character 'H'. The operations allowed are "Copy All" and "Paste".
Algorithm

To tackle this problem efficiently, understanding several key algorithmic and mathematical concepts is crucial. Here are the concepts needed for this project:

    Dynamic Programming: Break down the problem into simpler subproblems and build up the solution.
    Prime Factorization: Perform prime factorization to reduce the problem to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number n.
    Code Optimization: Approach problems from an optimization perspective to find the most efficient solution.
    Greedy Algorithms: Choose the best option at each step to minimize the number of operations.
    Basic Python Programming: Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution.

Tasks
0. Minimum Operations

In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. The text editor can execute only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste". Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

    Prototype: def minOperations(n)
    Returns: An integer
    If n is impossible to achieve, return 0
