Lockboxes

Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an algorithm to solve the "Lockboxes" problem in Python. The goal is to determine if all the boxes can be opened given a set of keys. Each box is numbered sequentially, and each box may contain keys to other boxes.

Must Know
To successfully tackle this project, you'll need a solid understanding of the following concepts:

Lists and List Manipulation: Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically. Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)

Graph Theory Basics: Knowledge of graph theory concepts, especially related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph. Graph Theory (Khan Academy)

Algorithmic Complexity: Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is crucial for writing efficient algorithms. Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)

Recursion: Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys. Recursion in Python (Real Python)

Queue and Stack: Knowing how to use queues and stacks is essential, especially if implementing BFS or DFS algorithms to traverse through the keys and boxes. Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)

Set Operations: Utilizing sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process. Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you'll be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

Tasks
0. Lockboxes
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and may contain keys to other boxes. Write a method canUnlockAll(boxes) that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

boxes is a list of lists.
A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
All keys will be positive integers.
Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False.
