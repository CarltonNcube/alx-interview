Pscal's Triangle

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pascal's Triangle project! This project aims to implement Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical construct named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. It is a triangular array of binomial coefficients where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for generating Pascal's Triangle involves utilizing various Python concepts such as lists, list comprehensions, functions, loops, conditional statements, and optionally recursion. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:

- **Lists and List Comprehensions**: Use lists to represent each row of the triangle. List comprehensions can be employed for concise row generation.

- **Functions**: Define a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of lists representing the Pascal's triangle of size `n`.

- **Loops**: Iterate through sequences using `for` and `while` loops. Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal's Triangle.

- **Conditional Statements**: Implement logic based on the position within Pascal's Triangle. For instance, the edges of the triangle always contain 1.

- **Recursion (Optional)**: Understand recursion as an alternative approach for generating Pascal's Triangle. Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition for calculating each element of Pascal's Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.

- **Indexing and Slicing**: Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.

- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.

- **Error and Exception Handling (Optional)**: Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.

- **Efficiency and Optimization**: Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches. Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve performance.

## Task

### 0. Pascal's Triangle

Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal’s triangle of `n`:

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`
- You can assume `n` will always be an integer

Make it professional and straightforward without any ambiguity or unnecessary complexity.
